                <summary>Will an automatic sprinkler system use more water?</summary>
                <p>No, in fact an automatic sprinkler system may use less water! Our sprinklers have been specially designed to use up to 35% less water than our nearest competitors, and you'll never have to worry about leaving the sprinklers on again!</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Will an automatic sprinkler system water as well as I do by hand?</summary>
                <p>Our sprinkler systems will do a more efficient job, because we tailor our sprinklers to your lawn's diverse watering needs. You'll also never have to worry about accidentally missing a spot while you're watering again!</p>

                <summary>We get 40 inches or more of rainfall every year. Do we really need a sprinkler system?</summary>
                <p>If it rained at your house every three days, an equal amount every time, then you would not need a sprinkler system. The problem with relying on rain for watering your lawn, is that rain does not work like that; rain usually comes in ebbs and flows, with rain coming for a few days in a row, and then a dry spell of no rain. Even a few days without water can negatively affect your lawn's appearance!</p>
            </details>

		    <summary>What are the components of an automatic sprinkler system?</summary>
		    <p>An automatic sprinkler system comprises of: a controller, which functions as the brain of thee system; valves, which open and close to stop and start; and sprinklers, which distribute water to specific areas. This can be customized with rain shut off devices and drip irrigation zones.</p>
